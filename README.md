# TryHackMe Writeups

## **Introduction**
Welcome to my TryHackMe writeups repository! This repository contains detailed walkthroughs and solutions for various TryHackMe challenges and rooms. It serves as a documentation of my learning journey in cybersecurity, covering topics such as penetration testing, digital forensics, web exploitation, and operational security (OPSEC).

These writeups are designed to help others understand the approach to solving challenges while reinforcing my own knowledge.
