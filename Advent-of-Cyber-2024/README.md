# Advent of Cyber 2024

## **Introduction**
The Advent of Cyber is an annual event hosted by TryHackMe that provides daily cybersecurity challenges throughout December. Each challenge is designed to teach participants new skills in areas such as penetration testing, digital forensics, web exploitation, and more.

This folder contains my writeups for the **Advent of Cyber 2024** challenges. Each writeup includes a detailed walkthrough of the challenge, tools used, and key takeaways.

## **Purpose**
The purpose of this folder is to document my progress through the Advent of Cyber 2024 challenges while showcasing my problem-solving approach and cybersecurity skills. These writeups are intended to:
1. Serve as a personal reference for future learning.
2. Help others who may be stuck on similar challenges.
3. Demonstrate practical applications of cybersecurity tools and techniques.

## **Tools Used**
Throughout these challenges, I used a variety of tools and techniques, including:
- **Forensics Tools**: `exiftool`, Wireshark.
- **Web Exploitation Tools**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.
- **Scripting Languages**: Python, Bash, Powershell
- **Cloud Security Tools**: AWS CLI, CloudTrail.
- **General Tools**: Nmap, Metasploit.

Each writeup details which tools were used and how they were applied to solve the challenge.
